# 1. All of the questions in this homework use the Best in Show data set. 
#      The data is the file `dogs.rds`.
#   a. Load the data set and use R functions to inspect the number of 
#      columns, number of rows, names of columns, and column data types.
#      [code completion + comprehension]
When working with datasets in R, it is crucial to correctly load the data and inspect its structure before performing any analysis. Initially, when attempting to load the dogs.rds dataset, I mistakenly used the read.csv() function, assuming that the file format was similar to a CSV. However, .rds files are binary files that store R objects, whereas CSV files are plain text with structured rows and columns. Because of this, using read.csv() resulted in an error related to “embedded nulls,” which signaled that R was trying to interpret a binary file as text. This mistake led me to realize that .rds files require the readRDS() function instead of read.csv() for proper loading.

Once I correctly loaded the dataset using readRDS(), my next step was to inspect its structure to gain a better understanding of its contents. To do this, I used several functions in R to extract essential information about the dataset. First, I checked the number of rows and columns using the nrow() and ncol() functions. Knowing the dimensions of the dataset is important because it helps determine the scale of the data, whether it contains a small sample or a large collection of observations.

Next, I retrieved the names of the dataset’s columns using the colnames() function. Column names provide insight into what variables are present, allowing me to understand the kind of data available for analysis. Alongside this, I used sapply(dogs, class) to check the data type of each column. This function applies the class() function to every column in the dataset, helping me identify whether the variables are numerical, categorical, or text-based. Understanding data types is essential because different data types require different analytical approaches and transformations.

To ensure a quick and comprehensive overview of the dataset, I also used the str() function. This function summarizes the dataset by displaying the number of observations, the number of variables, the data types of each column, and a preview of the first few values. Using str() is an efficient way to check if the dataset has been loaded correctly and to identify any potential issues, such as missing values or unexpected data types.



data <- readRDS("/Users/wenchaoqin/dogs.rds")
# Inspect the dataset
num_rows <- nrow(data)       # Number of rows
num_cols <- ncol(data)       # Number of columns
col_names <- colnames(data)  # Column names
col_types <- sapply(data, class)  # Data types of each column

# Print results
print(paste("Number of rows:", num_rows))
print(paste("Number of columns:", num_cols))
print("Column names:")
print(col_names)
print("Column data types:")
print(col_types)

#   b. Make a scatter plot that shows the relationship between height and
#      weight. In 2-3 sentences, discuss any patterns you see in the plot.
#      [code completion + comprehension + interpretation]



To explore the relationship between height and weight in the dogs dataset, I used the ggplot2 package, which is a powerful tool for creating visualizations in R. The first step in the process was to load the ggplot2 library using the library(ggplot2) function. This package provides a range of functions to create customizable plots, making it a great choice for visual analysis.

Once the library was loaded, I used the ggplot() function to specify the dataset and map the variables to the axes. The aes() function inside ggplot() allows us to define aesthetic mappings, where the x axis represents height and the y axis represents weight. This mapping indicates that we are interested in visualizing how weight changes as height varies across the dog population.

To visualize this relationship, I used the geom_point() function, which creates a scatter plot by plotting individual data points. I customized the appearance of the plot by setting the points’ color to blue (color = "blue") and applying a slight transparency (alpha = 0.6). The transparency helps in visualizing dense clusters of points, making the plot clearer when data points overlap.

Additionally, I added a title and axis labels using the labs() function. The title, “Relationship Between Height and Weight in Dogs,” clearly communicates the purpose of the plot, while the axis labels, “Height ” and “Weight ” . This provides context for anyone viewing the plot, ensuring they understand the scale of the data.

To enhance the plot’s appearance and focus on the data without unnecessary elements, I applied the theme_minimal() function. This  retains light gray grid lines by default to improve readability while keeping the design clean. 


# Load ggplot2 for visualization
library(ggplot2)

# Create scatter plot
ggplot(data, aes(x = height, y = weight)) +
  geom_point(color = "blue", alpha = 0.6) +  # Plot points with some transparency
  labs(title = "Relationship Between Height and Weight in Dogs",
       x = "Height ", 
       y = "Weight ") +
  theme_minimal()  # Use a clean theme

The scatter plot shows a positive correlation between height and weight in dogs, with taller dogs generally weighing more. However, there is moderate variability in weight for dogs of similar heights, suggesting factors beyond height  influence weight. A few outliers at the upper weight range (~150 kg) may indicate large breeds or measurement anomalies.





#   c. Set the color of the points in the scatter plot from part b to a single 
#      color of your choosing. (Tip: Choose a color from one of the sites 
#      shared in the lesson (e.g. https://coolors.co/palettes/trending))
#      [code completion + comprehension]

The scatter plot was created using ggplot2 to visualize the relationship between height and weight in dogs. The aes() function mapped height to the x-axis and weight to the y-axis, and geom_point() plotted the data points. I customized the plot by using a teal color (#2A9D8F) and added transparency (alpha = 0.6) to reduce point overlap. The labs() function added titles and axis labels, while theme_minimal() removed unnecessary elements for a clean design. The plot shows a positive correlation between height and weight, with taller dogs generally being heavier, though some variation exists.


ggplot(data, aes(x = height, y = weight)) +
  geom_point(color = "#2A9D8F", alpha = 0.6) +  # Use hex code for color
  labs(
    title = "Relationship Between Height and Weight in Dogs",
    x = "Height ()",
    y = "Weight ()"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()

# 2.
#   a. Make a bar plot that shows the number of dogs in each "group" of dogs.
#      [code completion + comprehension]

This bar plot was created using the ggplot2 package in R. The ggplot() function is used to initialize the plot, and the aes() function maps the group variable to the x-axis, which represents the different groups of dogs. By using geom_bar(), the plot automatically counts the number of dogs in each group and displays the counts as bars.

The fill = "#E76F51" argument customizes the color of the bars to a warm shade of orange, making the plot visually appealing. The labs() function adds a title, “Number of Dogs in Each Group,” and axis labels to provide context for the x-axis (“Dog Group”) and y-axis (“Count of Dogs”).

The theme_minimal() function is used to apply a clean and simple design, removing  non-essential elements, allowing the focus to remain on the data itself. This bar plot clearly displays how many dogs belong to each group, helping to compare group sizes easily.

  
# Load ggplot2 for visualization
library(ggplot2)

# Create bar plot showing the number of dogs in each group
ggplot(data, aes(x = group)) + 
  geom_bar(fill = "#E76F51") +  # Bar color set to a shade of orange
  labs(
    title = "Number of Dogs in Each Group",
    x = "Dog Group",
    y = "Count of Dogs"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()  # Apply minimal theme for cleaner appearance

#   b. Are any groups much larger or smaller than the others? Describe what your 
#       visualization shows.
#      [interpretation]
The visualization shows that terrier and sporting groups are significantly larger than others. In contrast,  non-sporting and toy groups appear much smaller than others. The working ,herding and hound groups fall somewhere in between.  
Terrier and sporting are markedly overrepresented, suggesting popularity, breed availability, or sampling bias in the dataset.  
Non-sporting and toy Are Rare: Their low counts may reflect niche roles, fewer breeds, or less common ownership.  
Imbalance Highlighted: The stark disparity between groups could indicate uneven distribution in the data, which might warrant further investigation into data collection methods or breed classifications.  
This visualization clearly emphasizes skewed group sizes, which is critical for understanding biases or trends in the dataset.


#   c. Fill in the bars based on the size of the dog, and set the position 
#       argument of the bar geometry to the one you think best communicates the 
#       data. Explain why you chose this position.
#      [code completion + comprehension + interpretation]

In this plot, I used ggplot2 to visualize the number of dogs in each group, with the bars filled based on the dog’s size (i.e., small, medium, or large). The aes() function maps the group variable to the x-axis and the size variable to the fill color. The geom_bar() function automatically calculates the counts and creates the bars, while the position = "stack" argument stacks the bars according to the dog’s size within each group.

The choice of position = "stack" allows the viewer to clearly see the total number of dogs in each group, as well as the proportion of each size category within that group. Stacking the bars provides insight into the distribution of dog sizes within each group, making it easy to compare both the total number of dogs and the relative size composition of each group.

I opted for custom colors for the dog sizes: a warm orange (#E76F51) for small, a cool teal (#2A9D8F) for medium, and a soft light green (#F1FAEE) for large dogs. These colors make the plot visually appealing and distinguishable while maintaining clarity in interpreting the categories.
  
Arranging the bars from small to large in a bar plot follows a logical progression, making the data more intuitive to interpret. This order helps viewers easily understand the size distribution, as it mirrors natural categorization. Placing the smallest category first and the largest last highlights trends in the data, such as increasing or decreasing proportions. It also allows for a clearer comparison between groups, emphasizing differences in size composition. This approach reduces cognitive load and provides a smooth visual flow, ensuring consistency across plots and making it easier for viewers to compare data across different visualizations.

# 3.
#   a. Which geometry function makes a histogram? Use the ggplot2 website or
#      cheat sheet to find out.
#      [code completion + comprehension]
The geom_histogram() function is used to create histograms in ggplot2. A histogram is a graphical representation of the distribution of a continuous variable, where the data is divided into intervals or “bins,” and the height of each bar represents the count or frequency of data points within that bin.
aes(x = longevity) specifies that the longevity variable will be plotted on the x-axis.
binwidth = 1 sets the width of each bin to 1 year, ensuring that the data is grouped into yearly intervals. Adjusting binwidth changes the granularity of the bins.
fill = "#2A9D8F" gives the bars a teal color, and color = "black" adds a border to the bars, making them visually distinct.
labs() is used to add a title and axis labels to the plot, enhancing clarity.
theme_minimal() applies a clean and simple theme to the plot, removing unnecessary grid lines and background elements, making the data easier to interpret.

The histogram generated by this function helps to visualize the distribution of dog longevity, showing how common certain lifespans are within the dataset. The distribution will indicate whether most dogs have a similar lifespan or if there is significant variation.


# Load ggplot2 for visualization

# Create a histogram of longevity

    title = "Histogram of Dog Longevity",
    x = "Longevity (years)",
    y = "Count of Dogs"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()


#   b. Make a histogram of longevity for the dogs data. How long do most dogs
#      typically live? Explain in 1-2 sentences.
#      [code completion + comprehension + interpretation]

aes(x = longevity) specifies that the longevity variable will be plotted on the x-axis.
binwidth = 1 sets the width of each bin to 1 year, ensuring that the data is grouped into yearly intervals. Adjusting binwidth changes the granularity of the bins.
fill = "#2A9D8F" gives the bars a teal color, and color = "black" adds a border to the bars, making them visually distinct.
labs() is used to add a title and axis labels to the plot, enhancing clarity.
theme_minimal() applies a clean and simple theme to the plot, removing unnecessary grid lines and background elements, making the data easier to interpret.
i think most of the dog typically live 12 years. 12 is the biggest number in counter of dogs in differnets years. also 11 and 13 are the second and third biggest number , so we can say 12 willbe the years that  most of the dogs lives. 


# Load ggplot2 for visualization
library(ggplot2)

# Create a histogram of longevity
ggplot(data, aes(x = longevity)) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, fill = "#2A9D8F", color = "black") +  # Set binwidth for clear grouping
  labs(
    title = "Histogram of Dog Longevity",

#   c. Inside the geometry function for histograms, play around with the bins
#      argument. (e.g. bins = 10, bins = 50). What do you think this is doing?
#      [code completion + comprehension]



I uses ggplot2 to create histograms that show the distribution of dog longevity, adjusting the number of bins to observe its effect.
First Histogram (bins = 10) is grouped into 10 large bins, meaning each bin covers a wider range of longevity values.This makes the histogram easier to read but may oversimplify the distribution.
Second Histogram (bins = 50) is divided into 50 smaller bins, capturing more precise details of the distribution.
While this provides a finer resolution, it may introduce too much variability (noise), making it harder to see overall trends.
Both histograms use the geom_histogram() function, mapping longevity to the x-axis and filling the bars with different colors (#2A9D8F for 10 bins and #E76F51 for 50 bins). The theme_minimal() function keeps the visualization clean and easy to interpret.
  
 The bins argument in geom_histogram() controls how many bins (bars) the histogram has. A smaller number of bins (e.g., 10) groups more data into each bin, resulting in a more general and smooth distribution. In contrast, a larger number of bins (e.g., 50) creates narrower bins, revealing more detail but potentially introducing noise.
Fewer bins (10): Provides a broader view of the distribution, making patterns easier to see but possibly oversimplifying the data.In this data, use 10 bin we can easy find the year that most of the dog lives.
More bins (50): Gives finer detail but may make the histogram appear  misleading .It become difficult to find the number we need, both 10 and 12 are high ,it makes more noisy.

# 4.
#   a. Modify your plot from Question 1 so that the shape of the points is
#      determined by the "group" of the dog. [code completion + comprehension]


  
  In this task, my goal was to modify the scatter plot to manually assign shapes to each group of dogs, making it easier to distinguish between them. The first decision I made was to use the scale_shape_manual() function, which allows me to specify custom shapes for each dog group. I used values = 1:7 to assign seven distinct shapes, ensuring that each dog group has a unique shape on the plot. This helps prevent any confusion caused by similar shapes and makes it easier to visually compare the groups based on their height and weight.

I also increased the point size to size = 3 and adjusted the transparency with alpha = 0.8. The increase in size ensures that the points are large enough to be easily visible, even when there are many overlapping data points. The transparency setting helps reduce the clutter, making it easier to see overlapping points without losing too much information.

 I focused on the aesthetics of the plot. I used labs() to add a title and more descriptive axis labels. The labels now include units (“Height” and “Weight”), which gives the plot more context and makes it clearer to the viewer what the measurements represent. To make the plot even cleaner, I applied the theme_minimal() function, which removes unnecessary gridlines and background elements, allowing the focus to remain on the data.

 I improved the legend by using guides(shape = guide_legend(title = "Dog Group")). This changes the title of the legend, ensuring that it clearly indicates what the shapes represent—each dog group. This is important for making the plot more intuitive and user-friendly, as it provides context for understanding the different shapes and their corresponding groups.



  # Load ggplot2
  library(ggplot2)
  
  # Manually assign shapes to all groups
  ggplot(data, aes(x = height, y = weight, shape = group)) + 
    geom_point(color = "#2A9D8F", size = 3, alpha = 0.8) +  # Increase size and transparency
    scale_shape_manual(values = 1:7) +  # Assign unique shapes for 7 groups
    labs(
      title = "Relationship Between Height and Weight in Dogs by Group",
      x = "Height ",  # Fixed axis labels (added units)
      y = "Weight "
    ) +
    theme_minimal() +
    guides(shape = guide_legend(title = "Dog Group"))  # Improve legend title



#   b. Do height and weight effectively separate the different groups of dogs?
#      In other words, are there clear boundaries between the groups in the
#      plot (as opposed to being mixed together)? Are some groups better
#      separated than others?
#      [interpretation]

  The scatter plot reveals that height and weight partially differentiate dog groups, but clear boundaries are limited. 
   Taller dogs generally weigh more, as expected. However, this trend spans multiple groups, leading to overlap.
Working and Sporting Dogs likely occupy the upper-right quadrant (higher height/weight), but overlap occurs because both include large breeds .Working Dogs are Often larger but may overlap with sporting dogs in the upper range.
Toy  cluster in the lower-left (low height/weight), while non-sporting dogs—being a diverse category—show variability, overlapping with mid-sized groups.
Toy Dogs are distinctly small in both height and weight, forming a cluster with minimal overlap.
Hound and Herding overlap significantly in height/weight ranges.
non-Sporting’s diversity leads to broad dispersion, blending with multiple groups.
 Most groups blend into one another, indicating that height and weight alone are insufficient for definitive separation.
While height and weight provide a foundational understanding of dog size, they do not effectively separate most groups due to overlapping ranges. Toy and working groups are better distinguished, but mid-sized and diverse categories (hound, herding, non-sporting) remain intermixed. For robust group separation, additional variables or more granular data (e.g., breed-specific measurements) would be necessary.

# 5. In a paragraph, answer the following questions for the “Best in Show” 
#    visualization (https://informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/best-in-show-whats-the-top-data-dog/) 
#    that was built using the dogs dataset.
#    a. Who do you think is the intended audience for this data visualization? 
#        How do you think that could influence data collection, metrics calculations, 
#        and graphics choices?
#       [interpretation]


The "Best in Show" visualization likely targets prospective dog owners and dog enthusiasts seeking data-driven insights to compare breeds, as well as casual audiences drawn to engaging infographics. 
Metrics are simplified into intuitive scores (e.g., "family-friendly" rankings) to aid decision-making, avoiding overly technical jargon. Graphics use playful, colorful design(e.g., dog icons, interactive filters) to make complex data accessible,
while interactive elements allow users to tailor views to their needs (e.g., filtering by apartment suitability). The blend of aesthetics and functionality reflects a balance between informing non-experts and maintaining analytical depth, ensuring the viz appeals to both emotion-driven pet seekers and data-curious viewers.

#    b. Who/what is included in this data visualization and who is left out? 
#        What do you think the impact of that decision could be on conclusions drawn
#        from viewers of the data visualization? 
#       [interpretation]

The "Best in Show" visualization primarily includes standardized, purebred dog breeds with ample historical and registrational data. These breeds are likely selected due to their popularity, established metrics (e.g., energy levels, health risks), and availability in datasets from sources like veterinary studies or breed registries. However, the visualization excludes mixed breeds, rare breeds, and dogs from regions underrepresented in Western-centric datasets . It may also overlook nuanced factors like adaptability to specific climates, shelter availability, or breed-specific legislation.  

This exclusion narrows the scope of "ideal" dogs to those with quantifiable, mainstream appeal, potentially reinforcing biases toward purebreds and popular breeds. Viewers might conclude that only the included breeds are suitable, overlooking mixed breeds or rare breeds that could better match their lifestyle. For example, excluding mixed breeds—often healthier and more adaptable—might steer adopters toward purebreds with higher genetic health risks. Similarly, omitting regional breeds could limit global relevance. The lack of metrics like shelter population or ethical breeding concerns might also downplay adoption advocacy. Ultimately, the visualization risks promoting homogeneity in pet choices, perpetuating demand for popular breeds while sidelining equally deserving, less data-rich options.
#    c. What could the potential impact of this visualization be on those 
#       who are left-out? [interpretation]
(Due to technical issues, the search service is temporarily unavailable.)

The exclusion of mixed breeds, rare breeds, and non-Western breeds in the “Best in Show” visualization could perpetuate systemic inequities and biases in how dogs are perceived and valued. 
Mixed-breed dogs often overrepresented in shelters—may face reduced visibility and adoption interest if viewers prioritize “ideal” purebreds highlighted in the viz, exacerbating shelter overcrowding. 
Rare or indigenous breeds being excluded from the dataset could further decline in popularity, threatening genetic diversity and cultural heritage tied to those breeds. Meanwhile, the focus on purebreds might inadvertently reinforce unethical breeding practices (e.g., puppy mills) by emphasizing demand for standardized breeds with known health risks.
For global audiences, the omission of breeds popular in non-Western regions  could marginalize culturally significant dogs, narrowing perceptions of “desirable” pets to a Western-centric ideal. Ultimately, the visualization risks amplifying a cycle where excluded breeds receive less advocacy, funding, or conservation effort, while overrepresented breeds dominate public attention and resources—a dynamic that mirrors broader issues of representation bias in data-driven narratives.

# 6. Select your favorite data visualization from https://viz.wtf/ 
# (that was not featured during class or in the reader). 
#   a. Type the direct url to the viz you selected here:
https://www.dreamstime.com/composition-bee-honey-vector-illustration-labeled-food-structure-scheme-educational-percentage-graphic-organic-glucose-image187241266
#   b. Describe in a few sentences the "data story" you think that this visualization 
#       is trying to tell.
The visualization aims to communicate the chemical composition of honey by breaking down the percentages of its primary components: glucose (31.0%), fructose (38.5%), water (17.1%), maltose (7.2%), trisaccharides (4.2%), and trace amounts of carbohydrates, vitamins, and enzymes. The implied story is that honey is predominantly composed of fructose and glucose, with smaller contributions from water, maltose, and other minor components. However, the lack of a percentage for "carbohydrates, vitamins, enzymes" introduces ambiguity, weakening the clarity of the narrative.



#   c. In a paragraph, what makes this a "bad" visualization? Evaluate the visualization 
#       based on the visualization principles and perception rules discussed in class 
#       (i.e., Gestalt principles, plot type, accessibility, critical reading, etc.), 
#       and suggest a few changes to improve the graphic.
This visualization is ineffective because it uses a 3D, irregularly shaped, and distorted pie chart, making it difficult to compare segment sizes accurately. The hexagonal shape and tilted perspective violate Gestalt principles, particularly the principle of simplicity, as it introduces unnecessary complexity. Additionally, the small text size and color contrast make some labels hard to read, reducing accessibility. The inclusion of a bee illustration, while visually appealing, does not add functional value and may distract from the main message. To improve this graphic, the data should be presented using a standard 2D pie chart or, better yet, a bar chart, which would allow for easier comparison of the different components of honey. Furthermore, using a more neutral color palette with higher contrast for readability and ensuring that segment labels are placed clearly outside the chart would enhance clarity.



#   d. Describe in 1-2 sentences one thing that this visualization actually already does well.

One positive aspect of this visualization is that it effectively groups and labels the different components of honey in a visually engaging way, making it easier for viewers to recognize key elements at a glance. Additionally, the use of color coding helps distinguish between different categories, aiding in quick comprehension.

# 7. Look at the plot posted with this assignment on Canvas.
#    a. Identify the marks and channels in this plot. Write them out for this answer
Marks (geometric objects in the plot):
  Points (scatter plot markers representing dog breeds)
Channels (visual encodings used to represent data):
  Position (x-axis): Longevity (years)
Position (y-axis): Lifetime cost
Color: Dog group
Shape: Dog group
#    b. Write the code to generate this plot. (Hint: start with identifying the 
#        variables on each axis, then think about the types of channels).
# Load necessary libraries
To accurately recreate the plot, I started by analyzing its key components: the **x-axis (Longevity in years)** and **y-axis (Lifetime cost)**, which determine the position of each data point. The **dog breed group** serves as a categorical variable, encoded using both **color and shape** to visually distinguish different groups. To implement this in R, I used the `ggplot2` package, which allows for flexible and effective data visualization.

First, I created a **data frame** containing sample data, including longevity, lifetime cost, and breed group information. Then, I used `ggplot()` to initialize the plot and mapped **longevity to the x-axis** and **lifetime cost to the y-axis**. To differentiate dog groups, I mapped the `group` variable to both the `color` and `shape` aesthetics, ensuring each group is easily distinguishable. 

Next, I used `geom_point(size = 3)` to create the scatterplot, setting an appropriate point size for visibility. The `labs()` function was used to add a clear **title ("Dogs")** and informative **axis labels ("Longevity (years)" and "Lifetime Cost")** to enhance readability. Finally, I applied `theme_minimal(base_size = 14)`, which provides a **clean background with gridlines**, making the plot easier to interpret while maintaining a professional look.

This approach ensures that the final visualization closely matches the original, preserving all critical visual elements while following best practices for clear and effective data representation.

#    c. Propose 4 improvements to the plot based on best practices.
1. Fix the Missing Symbol in the Legend ("working" group issue)  
 The "working" group is listed in the legend but has no visible symbol , making it unclear which data points belong to this category.  

Check the dataset to ensure the "working" group has a corresponding shape and color assigned.  
Use `scale_shape_manual()` and `scale_color_manual()` to explicitly define a unique shape and color for each group, ensuring all categories are represented correctly.  

2. Reduce Overlapping Points for Better Readability  

  Many points overlap, making it difficult to distinguish individual observations.  


Use transparency (`alpha = 0.7`) to make overlapping points more visible.  
Apply `geom_jitter(width = 0.2, height = 500)` to slightly spread out points, preventing them from stacking on top of each other.  

3. Improve Marker Size and Differentiation**  
 Some symbols are too small or too similar (`+` and `□` are hard to distinguish), making it difficult to differentiate groups.  

 Increase marker size using `size = 4` in `geom_point()` to make points easier to see.  
Manually select distinct, non-similar shapes using `scale_shape_manual()`, avoiding similar symbols like `+` and `□`.  

4. Improve the Title for Clarity**  
  The current title "Dogs" is too vague and does not provide insight into the data.  

Change the title to "How Longevity Affects Lifetime Cost Across Dog Breeds" to clearly describe the relationship being visualized.  
Use `theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 16, face = "bold"))` to center the title and make it more readable.

#    d. Modify the code to implement at least two of those changes.

  I used scale_shape_manual(values = c(16, 17, 18, 15, 3, 8, 4)) to explicitly assign distinct shapes to each group. This ensures that every group, including “working,” has a corresponding symbol, making the plot clearer and the legend more accurate.
	Increased transparency by setting alpha = 0.7 in geom_point(). This allows overlapping points to remain visible without completely blocking the ones behind them.
	Increased the size of the points with size = 4, which makes the points larger and easier to identify, even when data points are close together.
	I changed the title to “How Longevity Affects Lifetime Cost Across Dog Breeds”, which clearly explains what the plot is illustrating. The new title tells viewers exactly what they’re looking at: the relationship between dog longevity and lifetime cost, and how this varies across different dog breeds.
